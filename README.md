The Gaming Room: Software Design Documentation

**Summary**\n
The Gaming Room is a client seeking to expand their game, "Draw It or Lose It," to a web-based platform that supports multiple computing environments. The game involves teams competing to guess drawings rendered by the application.

**Contributions**
In developing this documentation, I excelled in creating a detailed and comprehensive system architecture that addresses scalability, security, and performance needs.

**Helpful Processes**
Working through the design document allowed me to thoroughly plan the architecture and component interactions before diving into coding. This process highlighted the importance of clear requirements and design constraints.

**Potential Revisions**
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the initial user interface design. I would conduct more user testing to refine the UI/UX based on feedback, ensuring a more intuitive and engaging experience.

**User Needs Interpretation**
I carefully analyzed the clientâ€™s needs to ensure the game supports multiple teams with unique identifiers and maintains game integrity. Considering user needs is essential to create software that is both functional and user-friendly.

**Design Approach**
My design approach involved using industry-standard patterns like Singleton and Iterator, leveraging containerization for scalability, and ensuring robust security measures. In the future, I would incorporate more agile methodologies to iteratively refine the design based on continuous feedback.
